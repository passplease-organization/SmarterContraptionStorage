* If you come from China, you can also use [MCMODS](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/15306.html)
## What Can It Do?
* It is a mod aiming at making containers on contraptions smarter. After applying this mod, you can control your each container on contraption separately when them are blocks (planning to make them act like actors)
* Secondly, it adds support to other containers those Create haven't allowed, such as [Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) ,(planning) [TrashBins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trash-cans) and any others you request me to support
* Thirdly, it plans to add some interesting and useful features to create
## How to Give Me Some Advice
* First of all, GitHub is always the best place
* For Chinese, you can also find more links in [MCMODS](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/15306.html)
## About Plans
1) Add support to [TrashBins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trash-cans) (by the way, adding some interesting functions)
2) Make toolbox can act on contraption (and it will have more capabilities with TrashBins)
3) Make containers act like actors, which will allow us to close or open it without transforming entity to blocks
4) (Considering) Add support to liquid

## About Me
* The most important I have to emphasize, I am a newbie of making mod. So I may not update my mod so quickly as other authors, and codes worse than theirs. As a result, I will always ask some questions (including foolish questions) improving my coding skills.
## Questions I Encounter in Coding Now
#### Thanks For Anybody Helping Me First of All!
1) I don't know how to use accessTransformer.cfg file in forge. I know how to write it properly, but it can't work normally. For example, in TrashHandlerHelper though I change [inventory]() to public, I can't access it finally, but I can change Minecraft's code. So I suspect AccessTransformer can't change Create's code (although I have no way to justify that) Thanks for reading here helping to solve my problem.
2) For no reason, I can only open Minecraft's GUI in MenuProviderHandler. I cannot open mod's GUI whatever any mod it belongs to, and have no idea how to fix it.
