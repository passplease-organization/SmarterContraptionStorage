## What Can It Do?
* It is a mod aiming at making containers on contraptions smarter. After applying this mod, you can control your each container on contraption separately when them are blocks (planning to make them act like actors)
* Secondly, it adds support to other containers those Create haven't allowed, such as [Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) ,(planning) [TrashBins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trash-cans) and any others you request me to support
* Thirdly, it plans to add some interesting and useful features to create
